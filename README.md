# Netflix-EDA-Project
Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to identify trends in content growth, genres, and country-wise production using Python visualization libraries.

Netflix Movies and TV Shows Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analysis project focused on understanding patterns and trends in Netflix’s content library. The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows including release year, genre, country, and date added to the platform.

The project involves cleaning missing values, extracting useful features from date columns, and performing statistical and visual analysis to explore content distribution. Various visualizations are created to analyze the growth of content over time, comparison between movies and TV shows, most common genres, and top content-producing countries.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and storytelling using data visualization, which are essential skills for data science roles.
